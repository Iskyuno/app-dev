   > Shang-Chi, the master of weaponry-based Kung Fu, is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. This movie has some great fighting scenes that I really enjoyed watching.
## **A Silent Voice**

   > A Silent Voice tells the heartwarming tale of Shouya's reunion with Shouko and his honest attempts to redeem himself, all while being continually haunted by the shadows of his past. This movie made me in tears because of how beautiful the story was. You can see how Shouya try to fix what he had done in his past.
## **La La Land**

   > Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) and Mia (Emma Stone) are drawn together by their common desire to do what they love. But as success mounts they are faced with decisions that begin to fray the fragile fabric of their love affair, and the dreams they worked so hard to maintain in each other threaten to rip them apart.
